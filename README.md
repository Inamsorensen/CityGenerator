The Houdini Digital Asset for the City Generator can be found in city_generator_3.hdanc and an example of it being used is in test.hipnc

RenderImageWorks.png is a rendered image of a final artefact and RenderImageWorks2.png is an image of the underlying mapped and painted grid.

Python Module contains the python code used in the asset, whilst GeometryFiles contain the current geometry files for the buildings and trees, and ImageFiles contain some maps for the terrain and city.

For more information about using the digital asset, see its help card in Houdini.
